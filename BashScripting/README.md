The goal of this repository is to build strong command-line and scripting expertise that can automate Linux workflows, DevOps tasks, and system-level testing activities.

By the end of this journey, I aim to be proficient enough to:
- Write modular, reusable Bash scripts
- Automate common administrative and testing tasks
- Combine Bash with Python for hybrid automation
- Use Bash in real-world environments (servers, CI/CD pipelines, etc.)
